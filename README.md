# Note App using Android, Jetpack Compose, Dagger Hilt, Room Database, Navigation, and MVVM

## Overview
This is a simple Note App built for Android using various modern technologies and architecture patterns. The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and incorporates Android Jetpack Compose for the user interface, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Room Database for local data storage and retrieval and Biometric Lock integration. Navigation is handled using Android Navigation components.

## Features
- Add, edit, update and delete notes.
- View a list of all notes.
- Tap on a note to view its details.
- Notes are stored locally in a Room Database.
- App follows the MVVM architecture for better separation of concerns.
- Dependency injection using Dagger Hilt for cleaner and modular code.
- Biometric lock integration for enhanced security.

## Tech Stack
- Android Jetpack Compose: For building the user interface using a declarative approach.
- Dagger Hilt: For handling dependency injection and managing the app's component dependencies.
- Room Database: For local data storage and retrieval of notes.
- Android Navigation: For handling navigation between different screens.
- MVVM Architecture: For organizing the app's code into separate layers for better maintainability and testability.
